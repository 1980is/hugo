      <description>Cybersecurity - 2022 Roadmap? This is a question I have been asking myself over the last two months. How do I get into Cybersecurity? It&amp;rsquo;s a maze of opinions and ideas and I have listened to multiple podcasts, watched countless YouTube videos with some great people giving advice that I have learned from. But &amp;hellip; and I don&amp;rsquo;t mean it as a but that negates what I wrote earlier &amp;hellip; but I have to ask myself, what am I passionate about, what&amp;rsquo;s my vision of the future, what am I naturally good at?</description>

      <description>Why do we think it&amp;rsquo;s too late to change careers? Do you sometimes think I&amp;rsquo;m too old? Too old to learn how to skateboard, to paint, to learn another language, or to start a career in IT, etc. I remember being young and everything was possible. Life was an adventure waiting to happen. Where on the spectrum of life do we lose that spark? The openness to ideas and exploration. I&amp;rsquo;m turning 42 this month and it&amp;rsquo;s a great time for evaluating the past and the future.</description>
