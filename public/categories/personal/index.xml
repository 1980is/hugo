      <description>Why do we think it&amp;rsquo;s too late to change careers? Do you sometimes think I&amp;rsquo;m too old? Too old to learn how to skateboard, to paint, to learn another language, or to start a career in IT, etc. I remember being young and everything was possible. Life was an adventure waiting to happen. Where on the spectrum of life do we lose that spark? The openness to ideas and exploration. I&amp;rsquo;m turning 42 this month and it&amp;rsquo;s a great time for evaluating the past and the future.</description>
